# Front-End Udacity Nanodegree Projects
Here you can find exercises done by me during the Udacity nanodegree program.

## 1. *FroggerGame*
[Frogger game](https://rawgit.com/FDMOliveira/Front-end-nanodegree-exercises/master/FroggerGame/index.html) is a child game built to practice OOP javascript.

## 2. *News Aggregator*
News Aggregator is a web page that collects news from many sources, that had a lot of "jank" and the goal was to remove it. Therefore, the following performance issues were fixed: 
* Layout Thrashing
* Expensive painting
* Unnecessary layouts
* Long-running and badly-timed JavaScript
* Bad touch handling

## 3. *Resume*
This project is a resume built with information that comes from javascript objects and arrays.
