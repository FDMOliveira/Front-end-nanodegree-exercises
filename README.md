# Front-End Udacity Nanodegree Projects
Here you can find exercises done by me during the Udacity nanodegree program.

## 1. *FroggerGame*
[Frogger game](https://rawgit.com/FDMOliveira/Front-end-nanodegree-exercises/master/FroggerGame/index.html) is a child game built to practice OOP javascript.

Some Grunt task's were used to enhance the performance of the game:
* [Babel](https://github.com/babel/grunt-babel) To convert ES6 to ES5
* Uglify to minify javascript files
* [Cssmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin) to minify CSS file
* [Imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-imagemin) to compress all images

Todo List in a web app developed using a organizational paradigm **MV*** with help of Backbone.js.
