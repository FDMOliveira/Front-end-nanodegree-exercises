# Front-End Udacity Nanodegree Projects
Here you can find exercises done by me during the Udacity nanodegree program.

## 1. *FroggerGame*
[Frogger game](https://rawgit.com/FDMOliveira/Front-end-nanodegree-exercises/master/FroggerGame/index.html) is a child game built to practice OOP javascript.

Some Grunt task's were used to enhance the performance of the game:
* [Babel](https://github.com/babel/grunt-babel) To convert ES6 to ES5
* Uglify to minify javascript files
* [Cssmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin) to minify CSS file
* [Imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-imagemin) to compress all images

## 2. *News Aggregator*
News Aggregator is a web page that collects news from many sources, that had a lot of "jank" and the goal was to remove it. Therefore, the following performance issues were fixed: 
* Layout Thrashing
* Expensive painting
* Unnecessary layouts
* Long-running and badly-timed JavaScript
* Bad touch handling

If you want to compare, here is the [source site](http://udacity.github.io/news-aggregator/) and the [fixed one](https://rawgit.com/FDMOliveira/Front-end-nanodegree-exercises/ce3b77e/NewsAggregator/index.html)
## 3. *Resume*
This project is a resume built with information that comes from javascript objects and arrays.
